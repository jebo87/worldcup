# REACT WORLD CUP SCORE MANAGER
This is a React App I built when I first started learning ReactJS. It allows you to play with friends by guessing the scores of the different matches. The app will assign points depending on the winner of the match and the score after the end of the game.

This app currently lives in (http://rusia-makakolabs.herokuapp.com/), you can check it out by using the following credentials:

username: test@gmail.com
Password: gofullstack123

Users can also join using Facebook or Gmail (Facebook not configured in the current version)

Authentication and Database was done using Firebase.
